# CUDA programs
A repo containing CUDA programs for anyone looking to get started with CUDA programming. 

The problems are adapted from professor Izzat El Hajj's course on [GPU computing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRRuQYjFhpmubuwx-w8X964ofVkW1T8O4) which draws upon the content from a classic reference book `Programming Massively Parallel Processors by David B. Kirk, Wen-mei W. Hwu', Izzat El Hajj.`

All the programs are tested in an environment having Nvidia L4 GPU running with cuda version (12.1).
